Project Overview

This project is a Backend API designed to serve educational content, specifically courses on various technical topics like Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA), Python, JavaScript, SQL, and others. The API provides structured course data, including modules, topics, and content items (videos, code exercises, text explanations), to a frontend application (likely a web or mobile platform) for displaying and delivering the course material to users. The project uses FastAPI, a modern, high-performance Python web framework, and integrates with Firebase for authentication and data storage.

Key Components and Structure

API Framework (FastAPI):

The core of the backend is built using FastAPI. This framework was chosen for its speed, ease of use, automatic data validation, and auto-generated API documentation (using OpenAPI and Swagger).
Data Storage (Firebase):

Firebase (Firestore) is used as the database to store course content, module structures, and topic details. Firebase Authentication handles user authentication.
Authentication:

Firebase Authentication is implemented to secure the API endpoints. Users are authenticated using JWT (JSON Web Tokens). The tests use a mock authentication setup for testing purposes.
Course Structure:

Courses are organized into modules, and modules are further divided into topics. Each topic contains various content items.
The courses.yml file (from the Frontend project, included for context) defines the structure and content of the courses. This file is likely used by the frontend to display the course information. The backend API fetches similar data from Firebase.
Content Types:

The API supports different content types:
video: Video lessons (stored on Firebase Storage).
code: Code exercises with initial code and solutions.
text: Textual explanations and descriptions.
API Endpoints:

/api/v1/courses/: Retrieves a list of courses.
/api/v1/courses/{course_id}: Retrieves details for a specific course.
/api/v1/courses/{course_id}/modules/{module_id}/topics: Retrieves topics for a specific module.
/api/v1/content/video/{video_topic_id}: Retrieves video content.
/api/v1/content/code/{code_topic_id}: Retrieves code content.
/api/v1/courses/{course_id}/modules/{module_id}/topics/{topic_id}: Retrieves content for a specific topic.
/api/v1/payment/webhook: Webhook endpoint for handling payment events from Razorpay.
Testing Strategy

The project includes a comprehensive suite of tests using pytest to ensure the API's reliability and correctness. The tests cover various aspects:

Unit Tests:

Testing individual API endpoints (test_content_api.py, test_course_endpoint.py, test_courses.py, test_dsa_content.py, test_dsa_course.py).
Validating response status codes, data formats, and error handling.
Using mock data to isolate tests and avoid dependencies on the actual database (test_courses.py).
Integration Tests:

Testing the interaction between different components, such as retrieving course structures and content (test_content_api.py).
Verifying authentication and authorization (test_content_api.py, test_dsa_content.py, test_dsa_course.py).
Database Schema Validation:

Generating and validating the database schema to ensure data consistency (test_content_api.py, test_course_content.py).
Webhook Testing:

Testing the Razorpay webhook integration by generating signatures and sending test payloads (test_webhook.py).
Test Fixtures (conftest.py):

client: Creates a FastAPI test client.
auth_headers: Provides mock authentication headers.
mock_course_data: Provides mock course data.
db: Provides a Firestore client.
setup_test_topic: Creates a test topic with all content types.

Key Test Files Explained

test_content_api.py: Tests the content API endpoints, including retrieving course structures, video content, and code content. It also tests error handling and content consistency.
test_course_content.py: Tests course content retrieval and generates a database schema.
test_course_endpoint.py: Tests course endpoints with different URL variations, checking for correct status codes, URL normalization, and redirects.
test_courses.py: Tests course-related API endpoints, such as retrieving a list of courses and getting course details, using mock data.
test_dsa_content.py: Tests the DSA content API endpoints, focusing on retrieving course structures, video content, and module topics for the DSA course.
test_dsa_course.py: Tests the DSA course specifically, verifying course details, content types, module order, and content structure.
test_webhook.py: Tests the webhook endpoint for payment processing, including generating Razorpay webhook signatures and verifying response status codes.
Potential Areas for Improvement

More Comprehensive Error Handling: Implement more detailed error logging and reporting to facilitate debugging and troubleshooting.

Caching: Implement caching mechanisms (e.g., using Redis) to improve API performance and reduce database load.

API Versioning: Implement API versioning to allow for future updates and changes without breaking existing clients.

Input Validation: Enhance input validation to prevent invalid data from being stored in the database.

Asynchronous Tasks: Use asynchronous tasks (e.g., using Celery) for long-running operations, such as sending emails or processing large datasets.

Monitoring and Alerting: Implement monitoring and alerting to track API performance and identify potential issues.

Automated Deployment: Set up automated deployment pipelines to streamline the deployment process.

Centralized Configuration: Use a centralized configuration management system to manage environment-specific settings.

Data Validation: Implement more robust data validation on the backend to ensure data integrity.

Security: Implement security best practices, such as rate limiting, input sanitization, and protection against common web vulnerabilities.

How the Pieces Fit Together

The frontend application requests course data from the Backend API.
The API authenticates the user (using Firebase Authentication).
The API retrieves the requested data from Firebase (Firestore).
The API transforms the data into a JSON format and sends it back to the frontend.
The frontend displays the course content to the user.
When a user subscribes, Razorpay sends webhook events to the /api/v1/payment/webhook endpoint.
The API verifies the webhook signature and processes the payment event.
